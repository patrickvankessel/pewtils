Pewtils
===================================================================

Pewtils is a package of useful programming utilities developed at the Pew Research Center \
over the years. Most of the functions in Pewtils can be found in the root module, while a \
handful of submodules contain more specialized utilities for working with files, web \
resources, and regular expressions.

    planning to drop support for earlier versions if they haven't already. We highly recommend \
