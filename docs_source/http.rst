In this module, you'll find a variety of useful functions for working with web data. \
The :py:func:`pewtils.http.canonical_link` function is our best attempt at standardizing and cleaning a URL without \
losing any information, and the :py:func:`pewtils.http.strip_html` function is useful for attempting to extract text \
from raw HTML data with minimal fine-tuning.
